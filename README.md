# rSDI: Spatial Dispersion Index (SDI) for R

This package provides functions for calculating Spatial Dispersion Index ([Gençer, 2023](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12061-023-09545-8)) for R, and its visualization.

Spatial Dispersion Index (SDI) is a family of indices to measure spatial range of relations in a spatial/geographic network. The index was developed as part of a large-scale socio-economic study on flows between cities, and has proven itself useful for evaluating spatial range of flows for the whole networ or its nodes.

This package provides all variants of SDI as described in the paper (Gençer, 2023) and also provides functions to visualize index measurements on a network visualization plotted as a graph on a geographic map or a spatial base plate of your choosing.
